	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

	<small><p>This game will put your memory to the test. It's great excercise for your mind, while also being fun to play against friends to see how everyone's memories stack up! Everyone can benefit from playing because there's a direct correlation between memory games and improving your memory!</p></small>
